## ES6 Loops ðŸŽ“
---
  Syntax
  
    for(initialization;condition;incr/decr){    
    //statement or code to be executed    
    } 
    
    The 'for' loop includes some parts that are defined as follows:
    
       - Initialization: It is the initial condition that is executed once at the starting of the loop. In this part, 
         we initialize the variable, or it can also be used for the already initialized variable. It is an optional statement.
         
       - Condition: It is executed each time for testing the condition of the loop. It continues the execution of the loop until the condition is false.
         It returns only Boolean values that are either true or false. It is also an optional statement.
         
       - Increment/Decrement: It can increment or decrement the value of the variable, and it is also an optional statement.
         
       - Statement: It represents the body of the loop, which is executed every time until the conditional expression is false.
